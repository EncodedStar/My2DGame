---@field public VisibleCondition FNiagaraInputConditionMetadata @Declares the associated input should be conditionally visible based on the value of another input.
---@field public PropertyMetaData TMap<string, string> @Property Metadata
---@field public ParentAttribute string @If set, this attribute is visually displayed as a child under the given parent attribute. Currently, only static switches are supported as parent attributes!

---@field private bOutputIsPersistent boolean @Only valid if Usage is Output. Marks the associated FNiagaraVariable as Persistent across script runs and therefore should be retained in the Dataset during compilation/translation.
---@field private CachedNamespacelessVariableName string @Namespace-less name for associated FNiagaraVariable. Edited directly by user and then used to generate full Name of associated FNiagaraVariable.
---@field private bCreatedInSystemEditor boolean @Track if the associated parameter was created in the Emitter/System editor. Used to determine whether the associated parameter can be deleted from the Emitter/System editor.
